# Portfolio
It all started years ago as a hobby,creating simple Sited by watching youtube tutorials. Time kept passing but coding never stopped amusing me and i kept building on...using Unity i made an endless runner game in C#, i started experimenting with javascript, SQL, python, nodejs,ruby on rails framework and more...but still i had nothing to show.
I have a master in mechanical engineering and also holding a second master in advanced industrial and manufacturing systems but i realized my dream is to become a programmer.
In order to achieve this goal, from now on im gonna build my portfolio, witch hopefully will lead me into achieving my goal and start my dream carrier!
